# Implementation-and-Analysis-of-Digital-Control-Systems-Using-FSM-and-Combinational-Logic
Design and Verification of Finite State Machine and Combinational Logic Based Digital Control Systems
Scoreboard Controller:
This work involved the design and verification of a digital scoreboard controller capable of accurate 0–99 decimal counting using BCD representation. The system incorporates a reliable reset protection mechanism, correct 7-segment display encoding, and error correction through decrement functionality. Emphasis was placed on handling boundary conditions and minimizing power consumption, demonstrating an efficient FSM-based sequential circuit suitable for real-world scoreboard and counting applications.

Vending Machine Controller:
This project implemented a fully functional vending machine controller using finite state machine principles, supporting multiple products, coin-based payment, automatic change return, and robust stock management. The design cleanly separates control logic from data path elements and includes comprehensive error detection for insufficient funds and out-of-stock conditions. Its modular, scalable, and low-power architecture makes it suitable for practical automated vending and embedded transaction systems.

Traffic Light Controller:
This work demonstrated the design of a traffic light controller using optimized combinational logic derived from truth table analysis and Boolean simplification. The design achieves minimal hardware complexity, zero-latency response, and very low power consumption while maintaining safe and deterministic traffic prioritization. It serves as a practical and educational example of efficient combinational circuit synthesis and forms a foundation for more advanced traffic management systems.
